    <p><strong>A useful tool for traveling:</strong></p>

    <p>By understanding currency trends via graphes and current exhange amount we can determine what time is 
        good to travel. When a currency strengthens against another
        (The strengthen currency can buy more of weakened currency than before) things become cheaper for holders
        of the strengthened currency. 
        The Home page is for navigationing to other pages.The About page tells you about countries 
        your potential are visiting. The function page lets you put in currencies/ccountries to see the trends
        and current exchange.
